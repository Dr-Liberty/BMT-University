              "content": "In 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto published a whitepaper titled:\n\n\"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\"\n\nThe very first line stated the vision clearly:\n\n\"A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.\"\n\nThis was revolutionary. No banks. No governments. No middlemen. Just math, consensus, and direct person-to-person transactions.\n\nSatoshi also wrote:\n\n\"What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party.\"\n\nBitcoin proved this was possible. Strangers across the globe could agree on a shared truth without trusting each other.\n\nBut as Bitcoin grew, limitations emerged. To ensure security and decentralization, Bitcoin processes only about 7 transactions per second. A new block appears roughly every 10 minutes. As adoption grew, so did fees and wait times.\n\nThe peer-to-peer electronic CASH system became more of a store of value - digital gold rather than digital cash.\n\nBut what if you didn't have to choose?",

              "content": "Satoshi identified the core problem in the whitepaper's opening:\n\n\"Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model.\"\n\nBitcoin solved the trust problem. But another challenge emerged - the \"scalability trilemma.\"\n\nBlockchain developers realized you can only optimize for two of three properties:\n\n• DECENTRALIZATION - Anyone can participate, no central authority\n• SECURITY - The network is resistant to attacks  \n• SCALABILITY - The network can handle high transaction volume\n\nBitcoin chose decentralization and security. Visa chose scalability and security (centralized). Many altcoins chose scalability and decentralization (often at the cost of security).\n\nThe chain structure - one block after another - is what creates the bottleneck. Security requires work. Work takes time. The chain forces blocks to wait in line.\n\nFor years, people believed this trilemma was unsolvable. The blockchain structure itself seemed to force these tradeoffs.\n\nThen came a question: What if the problem wasn't the consensus mechanism, but the CHAIN structure itself?",

              "content": "Satoshi's vision was clear: peer-to-peer electronic CASH. Not digital gold. Not a settlement layer. CASH - something you could use for everyday transactions.\n\nBut as Bitcoin grew, that vision became impractical. Waiting 10 minutes for coffee. Paying $20 fees for small transactions. The peer-to-peer cash system became a store of value.\n\nEnter Kaspa.\n\nKaspa was created by Dr. Yonatan Sompolinsky - a Harvard doctorate holder and one of the most cited researchers in cryptography worldwide. He had been studying Bitcoin's limitations since 2013. His groundbreaking academic papers on blockchain scaling were so influential they were cited by Ethereum's founders.\n\nHis insight: Bitcoin's bottleneck isn't proof-of-work. It's the CHAIN.\n\nA blockchain requires blocks to form a single file line. Each block references exactly one parent. If two miners find blocks at the same time, one gets orphaned. Wasted work. Wasted energy.\n\nDr. Sompolinsky asked: What if ALL valid blocks counted?\n\nInstead of a chain, Kaspa uses a BlockDAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) - a structure where blocks can have multiple parents. No orphans. No wasted work. Parallel processing.\n\nSame proof-of-work security Satoshi designed. Same decentralization he championed. But fundamentally faster by design.\n\nKaspa doesn't abandon Bitcoin's principles - it fulfills Satoshi's original vision: true peer-to-peer electronic cash that's actually fast enough to use as cash.",

It identifies the \"main\" chain of blocks (the heaviest path through the DAG)\n2. Parallel blocks are ordered relative to this main chain\n3. Transactions get a deterministic order that all nodes agree on\n\nThe result: you get the speed of parallel processing with the consistency of a sequential chain.\n\nBitcoin maximalists often ask: \"But how do you prevent double-spends without a single chain?\"\n\nGHOSTDAG is the answer. Dr. Sompolinsky's research proved mathematically that you can achieve the same security guarantees as Bitcoin's longest-chain rule, just faster. This wasn't a guess or a hope - it was rigorous academic work, peer-reviewed and cited by the best minds in cryptography.\n\nThe protocol provides the same guarantees as Bitcoin's longest-chain rule, but without the 10-minute wait.",

That's 6,000 times more frequent than Bitcoin. And the network is designed to scale to 100 blocks per second.\n\nBut wait - wouldn't faster blocks mean less security? That's what traditional blockchain thinking says. \n\nThe assumption was: fast blocks = more orphans = wasted work = centralization pressure.\n\nDr. Sompolinsky's BlockDAG breaks this assumption. Parallel blocks aren't orphaned - they're all included.

              "content": "Bitcoin's security comes from proof-of-work - miners expending real energy to validate blocks. This makes attacks expensive.\n\nKaspa uses the EXACT SAME security model:\n• kHeavyHash proof-of-work algorithm\n• ASIC miners securing the network\n• 51% attack resistance\n• No staking, no validators, no trusted parties\n\nThe difference is structural, not security-related. Kaspa's DAG allows parallel blocks without reducing the work required to produce them.\n\nCURRENT SPEED:\nKaspa currently runs at 10 blocks per second - that's 600 times faster than Bitcoin. And the roadmap includes scaling to 100 blocks per second within the next 1-3 years.\n\nANTI-MEV BY DESIGN:\nHere's a security advantage most people overlook: Kaspa's speed makes MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) attacks nearly impossible.\n\nMEV is when miners or validators reorder, insert, or censor transactions to extract profit - like front-running your trade on a DEX. On slower chains, attackers have time to see your transaction and jump ahead of it.\n\nWith 10 blocks per second, there's simply no time for these attacks. By the time an attacker sees your transaction and tries to front-run it, your transaction is already confirmed. The attack window is measured in milliseconds, not minutes.\n\nThis isn't just speed for convenience - it's speed as a security feature.\n\nThink of it this way:\n• Bitcoin: One security guard checking IDs at one door, slowly. Secure, but attackers have time to scheme.\n• Kaspa: Many security guards at many doors, all moving fast. Same security, but no time for manipulation.\n\nThe proof-of-work is just as hard. The energy expenditure is just as real. The security is actually BETTER because speed eliminates entire categories of attacks.",

BETTER ARCHITECTURE\n   - BlockDAG vs blockchain\n   - 1-second blocks vs 10-minute blocks\n   - No orphaned blocks\n   - Scalable by design\n\n3. ROOM TO GROW\n   - Small market cap = high potential\n   - Active development\n   - Growing community\n   - Real technological innovation\n\nThe question isn't \"Bitcoin or Kaspa?\" - it's \"Why not both?\"\n\nMany Kaspa supporters hold Bitcoin too. They see Kaspa as the evolution, not the enemy.",

A path in a directed graph is a sequence of edges where the ending vertex of one edge is the starting vertex of the next edge in the sequence.\n\n**Directed Acyclic Graph** - a directed graph where no vertex can reach itself through a path that includes one or more edges, ensuring the absence of cycles.\n\nFor our purpose, we only need to know that Kaspa's BlockDAG is just a structure, consisting of edges and vertices, connected in only one direction, and that we never end up in a cycle - it is acyclic.",

          "title": "Introduction to Kaspa Layers",
          "content": "Kaspa operates on multiple layers to maximize both security and functionality. Layer 1 (L1) is the native Kaspa blockchain with its revolutionary blockDAG architecture, providing fast, secure, and decentralized transactions. Layer 2 (L2) solutions extend Kaspa's capabilities with smart contracts and applications.\n\n**Current Layer 2 Solutions**\n\n**Kasplex L2** - The first EVM-compatible smart contract platform on Kaspa, currently live on mainnet. It enables DeFi, NFTs, and complex applications while leveraging Kaspa's speed and security. Notably, Kasplex does not have its own native token—it uses wrapped KAS (wKAS) for network fees.\n\n*Important distinction:* The wKAS used for Kasplex network fees is technically different from the wrapped Kaspa tokens you might use elsewhere for DeFi applications on Kasplex, such as on Kaspa.com. While they represent the same underlying value, they serve different purposes within the ecosystem.\n\n**Igra** - Another EVM-compatible Layer 2 currently on testnet, with mainnet launch planned for Q2 2025. Igra provides an alternative L2 ecosystem, giving developers and users more options for building and interacting with smart contracts on Kaspa.\n\n**Why Multiple Layers?**\n- L1 focuses on being the fastest, most secure base layer for value transfer\n- L2 solutions enable smart contracts, DeFi, NFTs, and complex applications\n- This separation allows each layer to optimize for its specific use case\n- Multiple L2 options provide choice and competition, benefiting users\n\n**The Kurve Bridge**\nThe Kurve Bridge (https://kasbridge-evm.kaspafoundation.org) is the official bridge connecting Kaspa L1 to Kasplex L2. It allows you to move your KAS tokens between layers safely and efficiently.\n\n**Important: Understanding wKAS**\nWhen you bridge KAS to L2, you receive wKAS (wrapped KAS). This is a representation of your L1 KAS on the L2 network. While it maintains the same value, it carries different trust assumptions which we will explore in the next lesson.\n\n**Looking Ahead: vProgs**\nBeyond EVM-compatible L2s, the Kaspa research team is developing vProgs (Virtual Programs), a native smart contract solution planned for late 2026. We will cover vProgs in detail in a dedicated course.",

          "content": "When you bridge KAS from L1 to L2, your native KAS is locked in a bridge contract, and you receive wKAS (wrapped KAS) on Kasplex L2.\n\n**How Wrapped Tokens Work:**\n1. You send KAS to the bridge smart contract on L1\n2. The bridge verifies and locks your KAS\n3. An equivalent amount of wKAS is minted on L2\n4. You can use wKAS in L2 DeFi, dApps, and trading\n\n**Trust Assumptions of wKAS:**\nUnlike native L1 KAS which is trustless and secured by the full Kaspa network, wKAS requires trust in:\n- The bridge contract security\n- The Kasplex L2 validators\n- The bridge operators maintaining the peg\n\n**Portfolio Best Practice:**\nWhile L2 is great for DeFi and building, you should keep the majority of your long-term holdings in native L1 KAS under self-custody. Think of L2 as your \"hot wallet\" for active use, while L1 is your \"cold storage\" for wealth preservation.\n\n**Remember:** Not your keys, not your coins - this applies even more strongly to L1 vs L2!",

          "content": "Let us walk through the process of bridging KAS bidirectionally using the Kurve Bridge.\n\n**Bridging L1 → L2 (Getting wKAS):**\n1. Connect your L1 Kaspa wallet (like Kasware or KDX)\n2. Connect your L2 EVM wallet (like MetaMask configured for Kasplex)\n3. Enter the amount of KAS you want to bridge\n4. Approve and confirm the L1 transaction\n5. Wait for confirmations (usually 10-30 seconds on Kaspa)\n6. Your wKAS appears in your L2 wallet\n\n**Bridging L2 → L1 (Unwrapping back to KAS):**\n1. Connect both wallets to the bridge\n2. Select \"L2 to L1\" direction\n3. Enter the amount of wKAS to unwrap\n4. Approve the L2 transaction\n5. Wait for the bridge to process\n6. Native KAS arrives in your L1 wallet\n\n**Tips for Safe Bridging:**\n- Always start with a small test amount\n- Double-check wallet addresses\n- Ensure you have gas on both networks\n- Use the official bridge only: kasbridge-evm.kaspafoundation.org\n- Never share your seed phrase with anyone claiming to help with bridging",

          "content": "Let us walk through securing your Kaspa with a hardware wallet.\n\n**Why Hardware Wallets?**\nHardware wallets store your private keys in a secure chip that never exposes them to your computer. Even if your computer is infected with malware, your keys remain safe.\n\n**Option 1: Setting Up Ledger for Kaspa**\n1. Purchase a Ledger directly from ledger.com (never buy used)\n2. Initialize the device and write down your 24-word seed phrase\n3. Install Ledger Live on your computer\n4. Install the Kaspa app on your Ledger\n5. Create a Kaspa account in Ledger Live\n6. Verify your receive address on the Ledger screen\n7. Your funds are now secured by the hardware wallet\n\n**Option 2: Setting Up Tangem for Kaspa**\n1. Purchase Tangem cards directly from tangem.com (2 or 3 card pack recommended)\n2. Download the Tangem app on your smartphone\n3. Create a new wallet by tapping the card to your phone\n4. Your private key is generated on the card and never leaves it\n5. Link additional cards as backups (they share the same wallet)\n6. Set an access code for additional security\n7. To sign transactions, simply tap your card to your phone\n\n**Tangem vs Traditional Hardware Wallets:**\nTangem trades the on-device screen verification for extreme portability and simplicity. Since there is no screen, you rely on the smartphone app to display transaction details. This is a trade-off: more convenient, but requires trusting your phone is not compromised.\n\nFor maximum security paranoia, Ledger/Trezor with screen verification is better. For everyday users who want cold storage that fits in their wallet, Tangem is excellent.\n\n**Best Practices (Both Options):**\n- Always verify addresses before sending large amounts\n- Keep firmware/app updated\n- Use a strong PIN or access code\n- Store backup seed or backup cards in separate secure locations\n\n**The Sovereignty Stack:**\nFor maximum security and sovereignty:\n- Hardware wallet for long-term holdings (majority of portfolio)\n- Hot wallet for daily transactions (small amounts)\n- Layer 1 KAS for wealth preservation\n- Layer 2 wKAS only for active DeFi/trading\n\nThis setup gives you the security of cold storage with the flexibility of hot wallets when needed.",

          "content": "Sound money is currency that maintains its purchasing power over time. It serves as a reliable store of value, medium of exchange, and unit of account without being easily manipulated or debased.\n\n**Historical Sound Money:**\nFor thousands of years, gold and silver served as sound money because:\n- Scarce and difficult to produce\n- Durable and divisible\n- Universally recognized\n- Cannot be printed or created arbitrarily\n\n**Properties of Sound Money:**\n1. **Scarcity:** Limited supply that cannot be easily increased\n2. **Durability:** Maintains value over long time periods\n3. **Divisibility:** Can be split into smaller units\n4. **Portability:** Easy to transport and transfer\n5. **Fungibility:** Each unit is interchangeable\n6. **Verifiability:** Authenticity can be confirmed\n\n**Why Sound Money Matters:**\nSound money enables long-term planning, savings, and fair economic exchange. When money is sound, your labor today can purchase goods in the future. When money is debased, your savings lose value and you are forced to take risks just to maintain purchasing power.\n\n**Kaspa as Sound Money:**\nKaspa has a fixed emission schedule with no ability for anyone to change it. Like Bitcoin, but with faster confirmation times, Kaspa embodies the principles of sound money in digital form.",

Pure fiat currency begins.\n\n**1971-Present - Unlimited Printing**\nMoney supply expanded from $600B to over $21T\n\n**The Result:**\n- $1 from 1913 buys what costs $31+ today\n- A house that cost $5,000 in 1950 costs $400,000+ now\n- Average savings account loses 2-7% purchasing power yearly\n\n**The Hidden Tax:**\nInflation is a hidden tax on savings. Unlike income tax, you are not even informed when your money loses value.

Before you can grow wealth, you must first overcome the rate at which your money loses value.\n\n**Understanding the Inflation Hurdle:**\nIf inflation is 7% per year (2022 official rate), your investments must return more than 7% just to break even in purchasing power. A 5% return with 7% inflation means you actually lost 2% in real terms.\n\n**Official vs Real Inflation:**\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) used for official inflation often understates true price increases:\n- Housing costs weighted differently than reality\n- Quality adjustments reduce apparent increases\n- Substitution effects assumed\n- Asset prices not included\n\nMany economists estimate true inflation runs 3-5% higher than official figures.\n\n**The Math Problem:**\nWith 7% real inflation:\n- Savings accounts at 0.5% = losing 6.5% annually\n- Bonds at 4% = losing 3% annually  \n- You need 7%+ returns just to stay even\n\n**Breaking the Hurdle:**\nTo truly build wealth, you need assets that:\n1. Cannot be inflated away\n2. Have fixed or decreasing supply\n3. Maintain purchasing power over decades\n\nThis is why scarce digital assets like Kaspa, with a fixed emission schedule and no ability to print more, represent a return to sound money principles.",

Unlike traditional blockchains that form a single linear chain, Kaspa's BlockDAG allows multiple blocks to be created and referenced simultaneously.\n\nIn a DAG structure:\n- **Directed**: Edges (connections) between blocks point in one direction only\n- **Acyclic**: Following the edges, you can never return to where you started\n- **Graph**: A collection of vertices (blocks) connected by edges (references)\n\nTraditional blockchains like Bitcoin force miners to compete, with only one winner per round. This creates a bottleneck. Kaspa's DAG structure allows all valid blocks to be included, even if created at the same time. This is why Kaspa can achieve much higher throughput.\n\nThe key insight is that a DAG preserves the security properties of a blockchain while removing the artificial limitation of single-block-per-round. Instead of discarding \"orphan\" blocks, Kaspa incorporates them all into the consensus.",

These are blocks created after that knew about this block.\n\n**Anticone**: The anticone of a block includes all blocks that are neither in its past nor its future. These blocks were created concurrently and neither knew about each other.\n\n**Tips**: Tips are blocks that have no future blocks yet - they are the \"leading edge\" of the DAG.\n\n**Selected Parent**: Among a block's parents, one is designated as the \"selected parent\" - this creates the main chain through the DAG.\n\nThese relationships are crucial because GHOSTDAG uses them to order blocks and determine which transactions are valid.",

Blue blocks form the main consensus.\n\n3. **Selected Parent Chain**: A main chain runs through the DAG, connecting selected parents from each block back to genesis.\n\n4. **Mergeset Processing**: When a block is added, it processes all blocks in its mergeset (blocks not in its selected parent's past).\n\nThe brilliance of GHOSTDAG is that it achieves the same security guarantees as Bitcoin's Nakamoto consensus, but allows for parallel block creation. This means higher throughput without sacrificing decentralization or security.",

It defines the maximum number of blocks that can exist in the anticone of any blue block.\n\n**What is K?**\nK is a security parameter that controls how many parallel blocks are acceptable. If a block has more than K blocks in its anticone, it indicates the block may be part of an attack or was created under abnormal network conditions.\n\n**K-Cluster Violations**\nWhen a block has more than K blocks in its anticone relative to another block's blue set, it's classified as \"red\" - meaning it's excluded from the main consensus ordering. This is how GHOSTDAG detects and handles potentially malicious behavior.\n\n**Why K Matters**\n- A higher K allows more parallelism (higher throughput) but increases confirmation times\n- A lower K provides faster confirmations but limits throughput\n- Kaspa calculates K based on the blocks-per-second (BPS) target to balance these tradeoffs\n\nThe K parameter essentially defines the boundary between honest concurrent mining and potential attack behavior.

GHOSTDAG's ordering resolves these conflicts - only the first transaction in the consensus order gets to spend the UTXO.",

MuHash allows incremental updates.\n\n**How MuHash Works**\n- Each UTXO is hashed to a large number\n- The MuHash of the entire set is the product of all these numbers (modulo a prime)\n- Adding a UTXO: multiply by its hash\n- Removing a UTXO: divide by its hash (multiply by modular inverse)\n\n**Why This Matters for Kaspa**\n1. **Fast Updates**: O(1) time to update when UTXOs change\n2. **Pruning Verification**: Pruned nodes can verify their UTXO set matches without full history\n3. **Sync Efficiency**: New nodes can sync UTXO set directly, verified by MuHash\n4. **Commitment**: Blocks commit to the UTXO set state via MuHash\n\nMuHash is what makes it possible for Kaspa nodes to prune old block data while still being able to prove they have the correct current state.",

This commits not just to the block's own transactions, but to all accepted transactions from the block's mergeset.\n\nWhen a block is added to the DAG, it processes transactions from blocks in its mergeset. The Accepted Merkle Root commits to which of those transactions were actually accepted (valid and not conflicting).\n\n**Why Two Merkle Roots?**\n- **Hash Merkle Root**: Commits to the block's own transactions (in the body)\n- **Accepted Merkle Root**: Commits to the cumulative accepted transactions (for UTXO state)\n\nThis separation is essential for Kaspa's DAG structure where blocks process transactions from multiple other blocks.",

Hardware requirements for nodes\n2. Network bandwidth and latency\n3. Security margins (K must be large enough)\n4.

Starting from the current block\n2. Walking back through selected parents\n3. Including blocks within the window size\n4. Using DAA score (not just blue score)\n\n**Window Parameters**\nKey parameters include:\n- Window size (number of blocks)\n- Sample interval (which blocks to measure)\n- Weight distribution (recent vs old)\n\n**Kaspa's Approach**\nKaspa's DAA is designed for high BPS:\n- Larger windows to smooth volatility\n- Frequent adjustments (every block)\n- Quick response to hash rate changes\n\nThe result is stable block times even with rapid hash rate fluctuations.",

Create periodic checkpoints (cryptographic commitments)\n2. Store checkpoint chain linking current state to genesis\n3. Delete intermediate headers\n\n**Security Preservation**\nThe checkpoint chain preserves:\n- Total proof-of-work accumulation\n- Chain of trust to genesis\n- Ability to verify new blocks\n\nSecond-order pruning is still being refined but represents Kaspa's path to truly unlimited scaling.",

Taking the timestamps of recent selected ancestors\n2. Sorting them chronologically\n3. Selecting the median value\n\n**Uses in Kaspa**\nPMT is used for:\n- **Time-lock validation**: When time-locked UTXOs become spendable\n- **Difficulty adjustment**: As a time reference\n- **Protocol enforcement**: Various time-based rules\n\n**Properties**\n- Always moves forward (cannot decrease)\n- Resistant to single-miner manipulation\n- Slightly behind real time (median of past blocks)\n\nPMT ensures time-based consensus rules remain secure even if some miners misbehave.",

Calculate PMT from selected ancestors\n2. Check timestamp > PMT\n3. Check timestamp < current_time + max_future\n4. Reject if either fails\n\n**Impact on DAA**\nTimestamps directly affect difficulty:\n- Timestamps determine block time intervals\n- Manipulated timestamps could skew difficulty\n- Bounds prevent extreme manipulation\n\n**DAG Considerations**\nIn Kaspa's DAG:\n- Multiple parents have different timestamps\n- PMT calculation uses selected parent chain\n- Parallel blocks may have similar timestamps\n\nThese rules ensure consistent timekeeping across the decentralized network.",

While the term sounds complicated, it simply refers to a methodology for miners or validators to extract additional profit by gaming the ordering or inclusion of transactions inside a block.\n\nMEV is a major topic in the future of blockchain technology for both Layer 1 networks (like Ethereum, which uses complex Proposer-Builder Separation systems to manage it) and Layer 2 solutions, particularly with Optimistic Rollups.\n\n## How MEV Affects You\n\nEntities that order transactions—whether Layer 1 validators/builders or Layer 2 sequencers—can monitor your transactions and act on them in several harmful ways:\n\n- **Front-running**: Jumping ahead of your trade to profit from the price movement you're about to cause\n- **Sandwich attacks**: Placing orders both before and after yours to extract value from your trade\n\nThis often feels unfair because it mainly benefits sophisticated players at the expense of regular users.\n\n## The Scale of the Problem\n\nMEV is a significant issue in crypto. According to the Bank for International Settlements, over **$650 million USD** had been extracted on Ethereum alone by mid-2022. The total across all chains since then is certainly much higher—likely running into the billions.\n\nThis represents value being diverted from regular users and protocols through these extraction strategies.",

          "content": "Let's walk through a real example of how a sandwich attack works. This will help you understand exactly how MEV extractors profit at your expense.\n\n## The Setup\n\nImagine you're on a DEX (decentralized exchange). The current price is:\n- **1 ETH = 20,750 KAS**\n\nYou decide to buy 1 ETH, so you prepare a transaction to swap 20,750 KAS for 1 ETH. You send your transaction.\n\n## The Attack Begins\n\nAn MEV bot sees your incoming order. It knows your purchase will make ETH slightly more expensive in the pool. So it acts immediately:\n\n**Step 1: Front-run (Buy before you)**\nThe bot sends its own transaction first, using 41,500 KAS to buy approximately 1.99 ETH. This pushes the price up—now 1 ETH costs 20,850 KAS instead of 20,750 KAS.\n\n**Step 2: Your transaction executes**\nYour transaction goes through, but because the bot bought ETH right before you, the price is already higher. During your swap, you pay an average of around 21,000 KAS per ETH. Your 20,750 KAS only gets you about **0.988 ETH** instead of the full 1 ETH you wanted.\n\n**Step 3: Back-run (Sell after you)**\nRight after your transaction, the MEV bot immediately sells its 1.99 ETH. Since your buy pushed the price up to 21,150 KAS/ETH, the bot gets approximately 42,088 KAS for its ETH.\n\n## The Results\n\n| Party | Outcome |\n|-------|---------|\n| **You** | Wanted 1 ETH, got 0.988 ETH. Lost ~254 KAS (~$20 USD) |\n| **MEV Bot** | Spent 41,500 KAS, received 42,088 KAS. Profit: 588 KAS (~$47 USD) |\n\nThe bot extracted value directly from the price movements forced around your transaction.",

          "title": "How Kaspa's BlockDAG Fights MEV",
          "content": "Kaspa's core design, especially after the Crescendo upgrade, provides natural resistance against MEV. Let's understand why.\n\n## The Power of Block Parallelism\n\nUnlike typical blockchains where only one miner \"wins\" and creates the next block, Kaspa operates differently:\n\n- **10 blocks per second** processing speed\n- **Multiple blocks created simultaneously** by different miners within very short intervals (around 100 milliseconds)\n- **No single miner controls** the exact sequence for any moment\n\n## Why This Matters for MEV\n\nIn traditional blockchains:\n- A single block proposer has full control over transaction ordering\n- This makes it easy to insert front-running or sandwich transactions\n- MEV extraction is predictable and reliable\n\nIn Kaspa's BlockDAG:\n- **Competition between miners** creates natural chaos in ordering\n- No single actor can reliably predict the exact transaction sequence\n- Multiple parallel blocks mean your transaction could end up in any of several blocks\n\n## Natural \"Chaotic\" Competition\n\nThis inherent parallelism creates what researchers call \"chaotic competition.\" When multiple miners are simultaneously creating blocks, it becomes **much harder** for any single actor to:\n\n1. Reliably predict transaction order\n2. Guarantee their MEV transaction executes in the right position\n3. Execute quick strategies like simple front-running\n\nThis aims for a **fairer system from the start**—not by adding complex rules, but through Kaspa's fundamental architecture.\n\n## Important Note\n\nWhile Kaspa's speed and parallelism make common MEV strategies much more difficult, they may not eliminate all possible types—especially more complex attacks or potential censorship issues. That's why Kaspa is researching additional solutions.",

Research and development (likely happening after the Dagknight L1 upgrade) will build specific L1-level solutions to minimize or stop harmful MEV.\n\n## Research Direction 1: Leveraging High BPS\n\nYonatan Sompolinsky (Kaspa's lead researcher) has discussed research directions where Kaspa's high block rate and miner competition could potentially lead to an environment where miner payments (\"kickbacks\") naturally match the extractable MEV.\n\nThis would essentially make unfair extraction **unprofitable**—a kind of \"wash\" where the effort to extract MEV equals or exceeds the reward.\n\n## Research Direction 2: Fair Ordering Protocols\n\nThis explores ways to make the L1 order transactions based more on **when they were received globally** (like a fair queue) rather than letting miners choose the most profitable order.\n\nThis is complex in a distributed system but aims directly at ordering fairness—if your transaction was received first, it should execute first.\n\n## Research Direction 3: Threshold Encryption\n\nThis technique **locks (encrypts) transactions** when they are submitted:\n\n1. Users submit encrypted transactions\n2. Miners order the locked transactions **without knowing their contents**\n3. This prevents front-running based on what's inside\n4. Only after the order is set are transactions unlocked for execution\n\nMiners can't front-run what they can't see!\n\n## Research Direction 4: MEV Auctions\n\nThis approach makes MEV capture **transparent and shared**:\n\n- The right to extract MEV would be auctioned openly\n- Proceeds would be burned or distributed to the community\n- Instead of hidden extraction, value capture becomes visible and benefits everyone\n\n## The Goal\n\nKaspa's research will focus on finding the best fit for its unique fast BlockDAG architecture.
